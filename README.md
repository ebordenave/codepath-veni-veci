# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni Vici!*

Submitted by: **Edward Bordenave**

This web app: **Dog Search App**

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Added conditional rendering for the attributes button. If a Dog did not have a certain attribute, the button will not be rendered.
* [x] Removed the possibility of duplicate attributes being added to the seen list (su-paw-stars) or the ban list (the dog house).
* [x] Contained the images such that they maintained their aspect ratio.
